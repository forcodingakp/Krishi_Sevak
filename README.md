### *An AI-powered Smart Agriculture Assistant*

**Krishi_Sevak** is an advanced AI system designed to assist farmers with precision agriculture. It integrates drone-based field analysis, sensor data collection, and a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to provide actionable recommendations and alerts for optimal resource management.

---

## üöÄ **System Overview**

- **Drone**: Equipped with **Raspberry Pi 4** and **Pi NoIR Camera** to capture **infrared images** of the field.  
- **NDVI Calculation**: The Raspberry Pi processes the images to calculate the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** and color-maps the field to indicate vegetation health.  
- **Sensors**: Collect real-time field data:
  - **Temperature & Humidity** using DHT11 sensors  
  - **Soil Moisture** readings  
  - Weather conditions via **Weather API**  

- **Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for farmers to:
  - View NDVI images and sensor data  
  - Receive AI-powered recommendations and alerts  
  - Interact with the multimodal LLM for queries and decision-making

## üß† **AI-powered Recommendations**

The **multimodal LLM** takes the following inputs:
1. **NDVI-processed images**  
2. **NDVI index values**  
3. **Sensor readings** (e.g., temperature, humidity, moisture)  
4. **Weather forecasts**  

### Outputs:
- **Irrigation Advice**:  
  Example: *"There is an 80% chance of rain tomorrow, so irrigation is not needed."*  
- **Resource Optimization**: Identifies under-irrigated regions using NDVI-based color mapping.  
- **Fire Alerts**: Detects abnormal temperature spikes and sends automatic alerts to the farmer.  
- **Disease Analysis**: Allows farmers to upload crop images for disease detection using **computer vision**.
